\section*{Description}
We will be analysing a Lua program for dead code, ie. code that will never be executed. We won't cover the complete language of Lua, as this is far too much work, however we will at least be supporting the following language features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Conditionals
	\item Loops
	\item Functions
	\item Tables
	% Nog verder uitbreiden?
\end{itemize}
Which we can extend with the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Higher-order functions
	% Idem
\end{itemize}
To achieve this, we will first parse a piece of Lua sourcecode. Both the parsing and analysing will be done in Haskell and the Attribute Grammar system. The parser has already been written by Falco Peijnenburg and can be used as is. We will extend upon this to analyse the input code.
